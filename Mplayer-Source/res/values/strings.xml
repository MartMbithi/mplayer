    <string name="ans_facts_about_queues">"
You can have maximum 20 Queues. 

Remember, too many queues, each with too many songs, can reduce performance, and increase app launch time and shutdown time. So it is recommended that you remove old queues if they are not required any more. 

If name of a queue is \"All songs\" or \"Folder123\" or \"Recently added songs\" or \"AlbumXYZ\" it doesn't become actual \"All songs\" or \"Folder123\" or \"Recently added songs\" or \"AlbumXYZ\". It just has same name. You can rename it to anything. After creating a queue, when you add some new songs to your library, they will not appear in any queue. To see actual and updating lists of songs go to the their respective tabs. i.e For actual \"AlbumXYZ\" go to Albums' tab (not in queue named AlbumXYZ), for actual \"Folder123\" go to Folders' tab and for \"All songs\", and \"Recently added songs\" go to Playlists' tab, and likewise. 

Name of a queue must be unique among all other queues. 

No duplicate songs is allowed in a queue."</string>

&lt;b>Short answer:&lt;/b> &lt;a href=https://youtu.be/J9-8Ct0n6c0>Watch this video&lt;/a>


&lt;b>Long but Proper Answer:&lt;/b>
Xiaomi's MIUI ROMs have very aggressive &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_(operating_systems)'>Memory management (RAM management)&lt;/a>. While multitasking MIUI keeps killing background apps(=App which are not visible on screen) in order to keep more and more RAM free.

Most of the times this strategy is unnecessary. Moreover Stock android's Memory management is really good. It is reliable and perfect.

But still MIUI uses its own Memory management. Decision made by MIUI for \"Which app to be killed first\" is sometimes poor.

&lt;b>For these reasons when you are listing music in background, while using other apps, MIUI kills Musicolet.&lt;/b>

&lt;b>Solution?&lt;/b>
Because it is a well known problem of MIUI, there are many discussions are there on many forums on the internet. Some users have found ways to tweak MIUI's behaviour by changing some settings from developer options.
&lt;b>Here is a Video with step by step guide:&lt;/b> &lt;a href=https://youtu.be/J9-8Ct0n6c0>https://youtu.be/J9-8Ct0n6c0&lt;/a>

    <string name="ans_shuffle_mode_vs_randomize">"
Shuffle mode doesn't let you predict next song until you actually play next song. 'Play after current song' option will also not work when shuffle mode is on.

An alternative to shuffle mode is Randomize. Keep shuffle mode off -> go to queue-tab -> Click on sort icon -> Select randomize. It will randomize the songs in the currently selected queue (a kind of shuffle), and now you can see the new random arrangement of songs, and can know which song will be played next."</string>
    <string name="ans_what_is_diff_queues_playlists">Queue is a temporary list of songs which decides the order of songs in which they are played. You can find queues in 1st tab. You can change the order of song in a queue, by simple dragging it from 2-bars given at left side.</string>
    <string name="ans_what_is_multiple_queue_concept">"
Mplayer is the ONLY android music player which supports multiple queues. 

Benefits of Multiple-Queues: 
1. You can prepare more than one queues while listening songs from some another queue. 

2. Suppose you have prepared a nice queue, and you don't have multiple-queues feature (i.e. if you can have just 1 queue like other music apps) and while exploring your library you accidentally clicked on a song from a playlist/albums/search/etc. Then with just 1 queue, either your old queue with replaced with new list of songs (which happens with most of the other music apps) or all songs of that playlist/album/etc will be added to your queue. And your nicely prepared queue will be ruined. With Mplayer's multiple queues it never happens. In such a scenario Mplayer will create a new queue, and your old queue will be untouched. 

3. Mplayer even remembers currently playing songs of each queue. 

You can even give temporary names to every queues, and rename any queue anytime. You can also save any queue as playlist."</string>
    <string name="ans_where_are_widgets">"
&lt;b>\"Whenever an android app is installed on SD card or moved to SD card. Some functionality of the app including Widgets became disabled.\"&lt;/b>

This rule applies for android apps including Mplayer. So &lt;b>if you want to use widgets, you should keep Mplayer app on internal storage not on SD card&lt;/b>.


You may ask:

&lt;b>I didn't installed it on SD card. It automatically installed on SD card.&lt;/b>

Answer: We (the app developers) have just 2 choices: Allow app to be installed on SD card or Not. As many users (having devices with low internal storage) were asking for this features, we allowed the app to be installed on SD card.
But 'Where an app will be installed?' is decided by Android system. We don't have any control on it.


&lt;b>How to move an app to Internal storage?&lt;/b>

Answer: (a) Go to your device Settings > Applications (or Apps) (on some device it may be in Advance settings) > Find 'Mplayer' and tap on it > Find and click button labeled 'Move to internal storage' or (b) Google \"How to move app to Internal storage in [YOUR DEVICE NAME HERE]\"

    <string name="ans_where_is_genre_tab">"Go to 'Mplayer' -> 'settings' -> 'Arrange tabs'. If there you can't find genre tab there, then sadly genres is not supported in your device. Some old versions of android have many bugs with genre in the mediastore db. As Mplayer is depended on it, Genres is not possible on those devices."</string>
    <string name="ans_why_cannt_edit_some_tags">"
If the song has corrupted ID3 tags, or doesn't allow ID3 tags to be written on it. Or have some other issues, then tags of such song can't be edited."</string>
    <string name="ans_why_cant_find_newly_added_songs">"
Make sure you are not finding newly added song in queues in queue-tab(1st tab). Find them in any other tabs. Because queues are completely different things from playlists.&lt;br/>
Also make sure: The folder in which your songs are or &lt;b>any of its parent folders&lt;/b>&amp;#8230;&lt;br/>
1) &amp;#8230;is not added in the list of excluded folders(see Mplayer>settings>'song library'>'exclude folders')&lt;br/>
2) &amp;#8230;is not a hidden folder and its name does not start with .(dot)&lt;br/>
3) &amp;#8230;is not a private folder of any app&lt;br/>
4) &amp;#8230;does not contain a file named '.nomedia' (.nomedia files are usually hidden in FileManagers)&lt;br/>&lt;br/>

If you still can't find your songs, read this:&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
Mplayer does a quick scan for the new songs on every start. For fast and battery efficient scanning, it uses Android's &lt;b>MediaStorage framework&lt;/b>. In Android MediaStorage framework is powerful mechanism for querying and keeping record of existing files in internal and external storage. Many apps including Gallery depends on it.

But, Sometimes the apps (like file manager, browsers, file sharing apps etc. from which have downloaded/copied/moved new songs) don't notify Android MediaStorage framework about the recent changes they made. So the MediaStorage will be unaware about those changes. This is a common reason for not finding newly added songs in Mplayer.
Solution:
(1) Do a force rescan. (Go to Mplayer Settings > Song library > Force to rescan)

 or 


(2) Restart your device. After it restarted and everything is loaded completely, then wait for another 2-3 minutes, then open Mplayer and try to find your songs.

But, Sometimes the apps (like file manager, browsers, file sharing apps etc. from which have downloaded/copied/moved new songs) don't notify Android MediaStorage framework about the recent changes they made. So the MediaStorage will be unaware about those changes. This is a common reason for not finding newly added songs in Mplayer. If other apps cooperate and follow MediaStorage's Guidelines correctly, then you won't need to use force-scan.


Anyway, The Rescan-Button given below will force Android's MediaStorage framework to scan songs inside selected folder and its subfolder; so Android and then Mplayer can find newly added songs.

You should only use this feature if you have &lt;b>edited metadata(ID3 tags) of songs outside Mplayer (Either by using other apps or a PC)&lt;/b> and you are not seeing those changes in Mplayer.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>If you need to use this feature, then please read this warning. You may ignore this warning if you are sure that the songs whose tags you want to reload from storage are using standard (internationally accepted) &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding>character encoding&lt;/a> for tags.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
&lt;small>Mplayer depends on Android's MediaStorage framework to read metadata tags. But after editing the tags of some songs, MediaStorage may fail to detect the correct encoding. If MediaStorage detects incorrect Character Encoding of songs then &lt;b>tags may be unreadable&lt;/b>. However, this rarely happens, if creators of song used non-standard encoding (encoding which is not internationally excepted) for tags. If this happens, &lt;b>it will not be Mplayer's fault and don't blame us;&lt;/b> We have warned you.&lt;/small>
